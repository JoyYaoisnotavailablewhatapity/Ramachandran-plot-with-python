# Ramachandran Plot

This project provides tools to analyze protein structures using Ramachandran plots. It calculates torsion angles and visualizes the φ (phi) and ψ (psi) dihedral angles of amino acid residues from PDB files.

## Features

- Calculate torsion angles between planes defined by atomic coordinates.
- Generate Ramachandran plots with density and scatter plots of φ and ψ angles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Biopython

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn biopython
